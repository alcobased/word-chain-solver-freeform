# **App Name**: Image Marker

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: Allows users to upload an image from their local device.
- Click Marking: Displays a circle at the point of each click on the image.
- Real-time Circle Placement: Adds a circle element at the exact coordinate on the image where the click event was triggered.
- Adaptive Image Scaling: The image is automatically resized to take as much space as possible inside the viewport.
- Circle Persistence: Saves marked circles to local storage and restores it upon revisiting the website

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#4285F4) for a clear and interactive feel, reminiscent of classic design software. The concept behind this color choice is approachability.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), providing a clean, non-distracting backdrop. The background is a desaturated and bright version of the primary.
- Accent color: Light Green (#34A853), used to highlight interactive elements like buttons. A cool-toned accent color can contrast the blue scheme effectively.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, to maintain a modern, machined, objective, neutral style. This will be used for all headlines and body text.
- The control panel will be positioned at the top, and use minimal space. The image takes up the rest of the space. There should be no scrollbars.
- Simple, clear icons for controls, such as an upload icon for image loading.
